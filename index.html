          <p>
            This document aims to outline and describe the establishment,
            objectives, and running of a new movement dedicated to the
            liberation of natives in South Africa. Following the 2024 national
            elections, it has become clear that political efforts alone cannot
            end settler minority rule, nor address the longstanding injustices
            since their arrival on our shores. The current trajectory suggests
            we are regressing decades, if not centuries, in our struggle for
            native land ownership and freedom. It is imperative that we explore
            alternative avenues beyond traditional politics.
          </p>

          <p>
            The settlers wield numerous powers and advantages that they utilize
            to advance their conquest of our land. Foremost among these are
            their financial supremacy, manipulation of politicians as puppets,
            control of the media, and domination over crucial systems and
            industries.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only advantage the natives currently possess is their sheer
            numbers, yet this advantage remains untapped and ineffective. Much
            of the native population is unaware of the true state of affairs in
            our land, primarily due to pervasive issues such as poverty and
            media propaganda. Various forms of chaos further obstruct the
            natives from awakening to their reality and liberating themselves
            from these shackles.
          </p>

          <p>
            What's particularly disheartening is that even among those natives
            who are aware of the true state of affairs, there remains a lack of
            unity and collaboration. Despite recognizing that settlers are
            sowing division and confusion, many individuals rally behind
            politicians who clearly prioritize their own interests, those of
            their families, friends, and financial backers, who happen to be
            settlers. Conversely, others oppose these politicians, leading to
            internal strife and chaos within the native community. Meanwhile,
            the settlers remain organized, united, and steadily advancing their
            agenda.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could fill a hundred pages detailing the extent and nature of our
            current challenges, but that's not the intent of this document.
            Here, our focus is on proposing solutions that can lead to favorable
            outcomes and better standard of living for the natives in South
            Africa: the empowerment of natives to exercise control over both
            power and land, ensuring equal benefits for all native people.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's evident that we must harness our numerical advantage to reclaim
            land and power, and sustainably protect and govern both. This
            requires uniting the majority of the native population towards these
            goals. Currently, internal chaos distracts and divides us,
            preventing collective action. To overcome these challenges, we must
            eliminate barriers preventing natives from recognizing the true
            state of affairs. This awakening will ignite concerted efforts
            towards reclaiming native freedom and land.
          </p>

          <p>
            This process starts with awakened brothers and sisters who are
            informed and committed to uniting, working diligently to effect the
            needed transformation. On social media, I've seen countless reposts
            and comments where hundreds, if not thousands, of natives challenge
            and resist settler attempts to undermine us through lies and
            propaganda. However, our biggest hurdle is our lack of organization.
            Despite our individual and small-group efforts, many of us,
            including myself, eventually feel lost and unmotivated, questioning
            the purpose of our struggle.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am calling upon you, my brothers and sisters, to unite and
            organize ourselves to fight for what is rightfully ours.
          </p>

          <p>
            As previously discussed, we must leverage our numerical advantage to
            confront the settlers. Currently, there are not enough native
            individuals who are coming together to collectively reclaim and
            protect our land, and to gather the necessary strength to sustain
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once those who are aware and committed have united and begun working
            together, our next step will be to awaken the rest of our other
            brothers and sisters. The campaign will be divided into several
            sub-campaigns, the details of which will be addressed later. The
            efforts we will make will target the various reasons and challenges
            preventing the rest of the native population from becoming aware and
            joining the struggle, and ensuring that at least the majority of the
            native population is working together.
          </p>

          <p>
            Poverty is one of the primary tools used by the settlers to keep the
            native population in a perpetual state of ignorance about our
            circumstances. Poverty affects nearly the entire native community.
            It is for these reasons that I believe one of the tools we must
            combat first is poverty. We will undertake initiatives that improve
            the lives of as many natives as possible. Simultaneously, we will
            educate them about our current situation and inspire them to join
            the movement. We aim to foster a culture where one native supports
            another, collectively striving for mutual elevation. Even small
            advancements or improvements in the lives of our people will
            significantly contribute to our cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand that bringing about meaningful change in the lives of
            natives, especially in combating poverty, requires significant
            financial resources. Unfortunately, I do not possess such resources
            alone. However, together, we have the potential to achieve this. My
            proposal is to establish a primary source of financial strength
            through monthly contributions from those of us who are able to
            contribute.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past, I have discussed with other natives the idea of pooling
            contributions to start businesses and generate employment within our
            communities. I have also observed similar discussions on social
            media. Concerns often arise about the management of collected funds
            and ensuring they are used for the collective good. These are
            legitimate concerns and reflect a healthy skepticism, which I
            respect. It is disheartening that while our adversaries efficiently
            organize their resources for their wicked goals, we always encounter
            more skepticism than support when it comes to funding or working
            together for our own liberation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite these concerns, I've reached a point where I prioritize the
            potential benefits over doubts. While I recognize we may not all
            feel the same, I urge you to temporarily set aside these
            reservations and envision the great possibilities if our movement
            succeeds.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe we can achieve all that has been mentioned and more,
            particularly if the majority of us are involved in the running and
            overseeing of the movement, and we establish stringent measures to
            prevent mismanagement of the collected financial power. The
            management of these funds will be transparent within the movement
            and, to some extent, to the public. I will explain the reasons for
            this transparency later on.
          </p>

          <p>
            The collected financial resources will primarily be allocated to
            initiating and supporting businesses owned by natives. These
            businesses will serve a crucial role in lifting our people out of
            poverty and contributing to the growth of our movement through
            increased manpower and financial resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            These funds will be used to expand the movement while simultaneously
            aiding our community in overcoming severe poverty. This support will
            continue until we achieve the goal of reclaiming our land and
            ensuring the well-being of every native individual.
          </p>

          <p>
            The businesses we establish will prioritize essential industries
            such as food production, materials for shelter, construction,
            clothing manufacturing, and medicine, among others. These ventures
            will not only help provide for our basic needs but also serve as
            educational tools, emphasizing the importance of self-sustenance and
            utilizing our land effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            I acknowledge that the financial contributions from those currently
            aware of our situation may not suffice to create a substantial
            impact. We need broader support. There are fellow natives who, while
            not fully understanding our cause, may recognize the importance of
            creating employment in impoverished communities or assisting the
            needy, and could potentially contribute. Unfortunately, due to
            settler propaganda and misinformation, many may hesitate to support
            our movement upon learning about it.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address this challenge, I propose establishing a publicly
            recognized Non-Profit Organization (NPO/NGO) as the public face of
            our movement. This organization will serve as a trustworthy entity
            to collect and manage funds dedicated to our cause. The businesses
            we initiate or fund will also be publicly profiled through this
            organization, showcasing the tangible impact of our efforts. This
            transparency will encourage more support and contributions from the
            wider community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certainly, there's much more to discuss and plan in order to
            effectively reduce poverty levels while expanding our movement.
            These efforts will be organized into campaigns known as the
            "Movement Expansion and Growth Campaign" and the "Movement Financial
            Management Campaign." Further discussions on these topics can
            involve input from all our brothers and sisters.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also want to highlight another significant tool used by the
            settler to advance their agenda: the media. In South Africa, most,
            if not all, media outlets are owned and controlled by settlers, who
            use them to spread lies, propaganda, and misinformation. This has a
            profound impact on the population, including myself, as I was once a
            victim of this manipulation. The media stands as one of the most
            potent weapons in this struggle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fortunately, we have a powerful tool on our side: social media. It
            provides us with the opportunity to counter the settler-controlled
            media. There are native individuals producing content that exposes
            lies, educates others about the truth, and challenges propaganda.
            Some natives may not create content but contribute by commenting,
            reposting, and liking such content. This demonstrates our potential
            strength. However, our efforts are often fragmented and lack
            strategic coordination, unlike the settlers' coordinated media
            dominance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I propose launching the "Media Campaign" as our next strategic
            initiative. The primary goal of this campaign will be to control the
            narrative and expose truth. Unlike the settlers, our narrative will
            be based on factual accuracy. We will create and distribute
            content—written, recorded, and visual media—aimed at native
            audiences across all social media platforms. Furthermore, this
            content will be hosted on multiple websites indexed by search
            engines for easy discovery.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's essential to counter fabricated narratives like the myth of
            "white genocide" or false claims about white poverty in South
            Africa. These falsehoods are deliberately manufactured by settlers
            to manipulate public opinion, and sadly, some natives fall victim to
            these distortions. We must act decisively to refute these falsehoods
            and present the truth without delay.
          </p>

          <p>
            We possess the numbers, knowledge of the truth, and a wealth of
            information to share among ourselves as natives. What we urgently
            need now is unity and strategic coordination to effectively
            challenge the settler-controlled media advantage.
          </p>

          <p>I cannot wait to work with you.</p>
